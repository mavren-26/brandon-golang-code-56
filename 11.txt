Problem  — Implement a Goroutine Worker Pool

Description:
Create a worker pool with the following behavior:

There are N worker goroutines.

Workers read tasks (integers) from a channel.

Each worker:

squares the number

prints:

worker <id> processed <num> → <result>


The main function:

sends 10 numbers to the worker pool

waits until all workers finish using sync.WaitGroup

Example Output

(Workers may interleave)

worker 2 processed 5 → 25
worker 1 processed 7 → 49
worker 3 processed 2 → 4
...

✨ Goal

Practice:

goroutines

channels

WaitGroup

concurrency safety
